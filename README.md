These files are adjusted to work wth the Tensorflow 1.3

1. Bulid RNN using tensorflow using basic functinality.(RNN.py)
2. Bulid RNN using RNN_Cell.(RNN_TFcell.py)
3. Build LSTM using RNN_Cell.(LSTM_cell.py)
4. Build Multi layered LSTM using list of cells.(Multi_Layered_LSTM.py)
5. Build Multi layered LSTM using list of cells with inputs parallelized across timesteps.(Multi_Layered_LSTM_Paralled.py)
6. Add dropout(Dropout_LSTM.py)
7. Tried Batch Normalization(Batch_Norm_LSTM.py)
